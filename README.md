📈 Stock Price Forecasting using Time Series (Apple Inc.)
📝 Problem Statement and Agenda
In today’s data-driven world, predicting stock market trends has become an essential part of financial planning and algorithmic trading. This project focuses on one such application — forecasting the opening stock prices of Apple Inc. using Time Series Forecasting techniques.

We use historical stock price data from the NASDAQ exchange, specifically focusing on Apple’s performance between 2018 and 2019.

The agenda of this case study includes:

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Apple’s stock price data

Applying ARIMA and SARIMA models for time series forecasting

Evaluating model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

🔍 Methodology
Data Collection

Historical stock data for Apple from NASDAQ

Focused on opening prices

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing trends, seasonality, and stationarity

Identifying patterns and anomalies

Modeling

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

Both with and without exogenous variables (if applicable)

Model Evaluation

Forecasting for test period time stamps

Evaluation using RMSE

📈 Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

statsmodels (for ARIMA/SARIMA)

scikit-learn (for evaluation)

📊 Result
The models were trained on a subset of the data and tested on future time stamps. The accuracy was evaluated using RMSE to determine the best-fit model for stock price forecasting.

🚀 Future Work
Extend to other time series models like Prophet or LSTM

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

Include interactive dashboards for visualization
